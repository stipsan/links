# Performance

> Information that isn't needed often is easy forgotten

When working on application code or product code there are usually much more important things to worry about than layout trashing or tree shaking.
So I won't link to things that are common knowledge or obvious (like the fact that you should subscribe to developer content from the google chrome team, use the Mozilla Developer docs etc).
Instead I'll link to quality content that is either a bit harder to find (not on Google's page 1) or content you don't look for unless you have some knowledge on the topic already (like layout trashing).
